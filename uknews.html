    <p><strong>Reform UK Surges Ahead in Polls</strong></p>
    <p>A recent poll indicates Reform UK leading with 35% support, significantly ahead of Labour's 20% and the Conservatives at 17%. If a general election were held now, Reform could secure a landslide victory with an estimated 400 seats. This surge is largely attributed to public frustration over immigration, particularly the small boat crisis. Farage's proposed mass deportation policy, which includes deporting 600,000 illegal migrants, leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, and using military sites for detention, has gained significant public support. <a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/15764245/reform-uk-leading-polls-over-labour-starmer/" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>
